Speaker,Teacher (T) or Child (C) Script (S),Utterance/Idea Units,Code,BackgroundKnowledge Explanation
33301,T,"Dani, is there a problem in your community that you would like to help decrease?",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not directly meet the criteria for the Building Knowledge code because it does not explicitly provide or request background information or facts, nor does it reference factual information beyond what is in the text. It is a prompt for personal reflection or opinion rather than a discussion aimed at building background knowledge about specific facts or information.
Step 2:"
33301,T,So that's a problem in your community that you would like to help decrease?,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not contain keywords such as ""What do you know about…"" nor does it explicitly request or provide background information or facts beyond what is in the text. It instead seems to be prompting an individual to discuss personal opinions or ideas about issues within their community, which does not align with the criteria for building background knowledge as outlined in the coding manual.
Step 2:"
444001,C,We should place signs in the water because I always see signs in water.,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not meet the Building Knowledge criteria as it does not provide or request background information or facts beyond what is in the text. It appears to be a personal judgment or suggestion rather than discussing factual information or building background knowledge in a scientific, historic, or other objective manner. The utterance lacks any reference to factual information beyond the explicit statement and does not incorporate the key phrase or any elements as outlined in the code notes.
Step 2:"
444001,C,XXX thousand birds from being her from some other place in the world was and that there were they left them all go in the truck and it was it was so beautiful.,X,"Step 1:#### The utterance does not explicitly contain the key phrase ""What do you know about…?"" but it implies a sharing of background information about birds being transported, possibly for conservation or relocation purposes. The reference to ""from some other place in the world"" suggests imparting background knowledge about the birds' origin which goes beyond the immediate context. However, the information provided is more narrative or experiential rather than the building of objective background knowledge as defined by the code. It lacks clarity on scientific, historic, or objective facts beyond a basic narration of events, which does not strongly align with the criteria for applying the 'Building Knowledge' code. 
Step 2:"
33308,T,How we how will an animal feel when released into the wild after being strapped.,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not directly include key phrases such as ""What do you know about…?"" nor does it explicitly aim at providing or requesting background information or facts beyond that in the text. The focus here is on predicting the emotional response of an animal being released into the wild after being trapped, which does not align with the criteria of building knowledge through objective, factual information. It revolves around speculation on feelings rather than discussing scientific, historic, or other objective facts to build background knowledge.
Step 2:"
33308,T,What if you wash them maybe by hand.,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not contain any keywords related to the ""Building Knowledge"" code, nor does it provide or request background information or facts beyond what is in text. It seems to be a suggestion for a method of action rather than a discussion aimed at building background knowledge on a topic. The utterance does not reference scientific, historic, or other objective facts and does not contribute to building knowledge in the context given by the coding manual.
Step 2:"
33308,T,Would that help?,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not specifically involve providing or requesting background information or facts beyond what is in the text. It does not reference scientific, historic, or other objective facts, nor does it discuss dialect/translations or present general factual talk to build background knowledge as outlined in the coding manual. The utterance, ""Would that help?"", lacks sufficient context or content to meet the criteria under Building Knowledge code.
Step 2:"
444001,C,"They will be surprised, happy even they might run off.",X,"Step 1:#### The utterance does not include any keywords or phrases associated with building knowledge, such as requesting or providing background information, facts beyond the text, or references to scientific, historic, or other objective facts. It appears to be a prediction of emotional or behavioral reactions rather than an effort to build background knowledge. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for the Building Knowledge code as defined in the coding manual. 
Step 2:"
33304,T,"Dani, what can you do to prevent your clothes from shrinking when you wash them?",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance requests factual, practical knowledge about laundry care, specifically how to prevent clothes from shrinking. It implies a need for background information or facts on fabric care, which aligns with seeking or providing information that goes beyond what is stated in the text. This can be linked to the Building Knowledge code as it involves imparting practical knowledge, although not strictly scientific, historic, or related to another objective fact as suggested by the examples in the coding manual. Despite this, it still seeks factual information that contributes to understanding a broader context, in this case, best practices in laundry care to prevent shrinking clothes.
Step 2:"
33304,T,"So, what can you do to prevent your clothes from shrinking when you wash them?",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance prompts the listener to provide background information or facts related to the care of clothes, specifically how to prevent them from shrinking, which involves sharing knowledge not explicitly stated in the text. It fits the criteria as it is requesting factual information about a specific process, which goes beyond what is explicitly stated and builds background knowledge on the topic. 
Step 2:"
444001,C,They feel confused because they probably feel confused because confused because they they didn't understand why they like caught them and release them back.,X,"Step 1:#### The utterance lacks the presence of specific keywords or key phrases (""What do you know about...?"") from the coding manual, and it does not provide or request background information/facts beyond that in the text. It rather seems to express a speculation about a feeling or a response to an action, rather than building background knowledge or discussing factual information. It doesn't reference scientific, historic, or other objective facts, nor does it discuss dialects/translations or general factual talk that is impersonal and goes beyond the text to build background knowledge.
Step 2:"
33308,T,"You wouldn't make them sick if they're not around you, germs, that’s true.",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance presents factual information related to health, specifically how germs are spread and the implication of physical proximity on the transmission of illness. It logically builds background knowledge about the nature of illnesses and how they are transferred from person to person, fitting the criteria for providing or requesting background information and facts beyond that in the text. The mention of germs and the impact of proximity on their spread references scientific facts that are not explicitly stated in the original text, thus meeting the criteria for the Building Knowledge code.
Step 2:"
444007,C,Because they just die one day?,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not contain any keywords or follow the code notes related to building background information or facts. It expresses a vague statement without providing or requesting any specific background information, factual knowledge, or additional context beyond what is explicitly mentioned. 
Step 2:"
444015,C,"Umm, give them food.",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not meet the criteria for the Building Knowledge code as it does not involve providing or requesting background information or facts beyond that in the text. It is a very general statement without any explicit reference to scientific, historic, or other objective facts. There is no building of background information or facts, and it lacks the specificity required by the code, such as discussing dialect/translations or referencing general factual talk that goes beyond the text to build background knowledge. 
Step 2:"
33306,T,"Now Dani, what can you do to prevent your clothes from shrinking when you wash them?",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance seems to invite the sharing of practical, factual knowledge on the care of clothing, specifically how to prevent shrinking during washing. While not explicitly tied to a specific discipline like science or history, it does request background information or facts about an everyday task—clothing care—that extends beyond what might be explicitly stated in any accompanying text. This aligns with the aspect of the code that involves providing or requesting background information or facts, even though it doesn't directly match the key phrase or examples given for building knowledge. The focus on factual, impersonal advice rather than opinions (judgments) also corresponds with the criteria listed in the coding manual. 
Step 2:"
33308,T,"They, they they don't exist anymore. What do you think happened to them?",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not include the key phrase ""What do you know about…?"" and although it asks for an opinion on what happened to an unspecified subject, it does not explicitly request or provide background information or facts that go beyond what is explicitly stated. Consequently, it does not meet the criteria for providing or requesting background information/facts that include scientific, historic, or other objective facts. It is more focused on speculation about an unspecified event or phenomenon rather than building background knowledge.
Step 2:"
444015,C,"Some people... XXX... some people, they they were actually XXX the dinosaur or a volcano doing it.",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not contain key phrases or a direct request or provision of background information or facts in alignment with the Building Knowledge code's criteria. It mentions dinosaurs and volcanoes, which could be tied to scientific facts in a different context, but without a clear emphasis on providing, requesting, or referring to factual information beyond what is stated or engaging in an educational explanation, it does not meet the criteria.
Step 2:"
33301,T,"So, Dani, what else can you use to protect your skin and prevent it from getting burned by the sun?",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance prompts the participant to provide additional background information or facts regarding methods to protect skin from sunburn, which extends the conversation beyond simple factual recall to encompass broader knowledge related to health and safety practices. It involves asking for information that builds upon what might already be known or discussed, aligning with the criteria for Building Knowledge by soliciting further information that is factual and extends understanding in a specific area (in this case, skin protection). The phrase ""what else can you use"" suggests a request for additional, potentially factual information beyond the immediate text or conversation, fitting into the broader category of seeking to expand on background knowledge.
Step 2:"
33301,T,"Do you, what do you do to put, to prevent yourself from getting burned when you go to the beach?",X,"Step 1:#### The utterance requests information about preventive measures against getting burned, which implies seeking knowledge about health or safety practices. However, it does not fit the ""Building Knowledge"" code criteria perfectly as it does not explicitly request or provide background information/facts beyond that in text, nor does it involve scientific, historic, or other objective facts unrelated to personal judgments or implicit knowledge. The utterance focuses on personal practices rather than expanding on objective, impersonal factual knowledge or background information.
Step 2:"
33308,T,"What can you do to control invasive germs that causes the flu when you're sick, Dani?",1,"Step 1:#### The utterance poses a question about controlling invasive germs that cause the flu, which implies a need for background knowledge on health practices or scientific understanding of illness prevention. This aligns with the criteria for Building Knowledge as it requests factual information about health practices beyond what might be explicitly stated in any text and pertains to scientific facts about illness prevention and control.
