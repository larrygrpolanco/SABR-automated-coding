33306,T,What would you do if you won a rophy?,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not meet the criteria for the Making Connections code as it invites a hypothetical scenario without making a direct link or comparison between the text and personal experiences, other books, media, cultural products, or the classroom/school's theme/unit of study. It focuses on an imaginary situation without referring to past, present, or future personal experiences or events.
Step 2:"
33306,T,What would you do if you won a trophy?,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance prompts a hypothetical scenario about winning a trophy, inviting participants to connect the question to personal experiences or imaginations of future events. However, the coding manual specifies that hypothetical statements are not coded under the ""Making Connections"" criteria. Despite asking for a personal response, it does not link to past, present, or future actual events or experiences of the teacher or children, nor does it connect to other books, media, cultural products, or the classroom/school theme/unit of study. 
Step 2:"
33301,T,"Dani, is there a problem in your community that you would like to help decrease?",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not specifically involve modeling an implicit link or explicit comparison between text and personal experiences, as it asks for a problem in the community rather than making a connection to past experiences, future possibilities, or other books, media, or cultural products. It does not contain the keywords or key phrases associated with making connections, such as ""Have you ever...?"" or ""This reminds me of my/our..."". Additionally, it does not express a connection to a classroom/school theme or a teacher's/children's personal experiences directly. 
Step 2:"
33301,T,So that's a problem in your community that you would like to help decrease?,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not contain explicit keywords or phrases listed in the coding manual under ""Making Connections."" It does not make a direct link or explicit comparison between text and personal experiences, future possibilities for events of teacher/children, other books, media, cultural products, or classroom/school’s theme/unit of study. The utterance is focused on identifying a problem in the community, without making a personal, direct connection to past, present, or future experiences, making it challenging to apply the ""Making Connections"" code based on the provided criteria.
Step 2:"
33302,T,"That’s a hard one I learned this too last week, when you wash clothes in cold water, it helps them keep their size perfect so that they don’t shrink.",1,"Step 1:#### The utterance includes a reference to a personal learning experience (""I learned this too last week"") which establishes a connection to past events in the speaker's life. This fulfills the criteria of linking to the speaker's personal experiences, as specified in the coding manual under the Making Connections code. The phrase indicates a sharing of knowledge related to personal experience, aligning with the requirement of modeling the implicit or explicit comparison between text and personal experiences. Additionally, the topic of the utterance (washing clothes in cold water) could potentially relate to the children’s or teacher’s experiences, events, or practical life skills, thus fulfilling another criterion specified under the code notes.
Step 2:"
444026,C,"Umm, don’t put them in the dryer too much.",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not meet the criteria for the Making Connections code because it does not link to children’s or teacher’s personal experiences, future events in a personal manner, other books, media, or cultural products experienced by the teacher or children, or the classroom/school’s theme/unit of study. It appears to be a simple piece of advice or instruction without making any explicit or implicit comparisons or connections to personal experiences or events.
Step 2:"
444025,C,"Uhh, my uh, because the park is breaking apart.",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not provide clear evidence of making connections between the text and personal experiences, future events, or cultural products directly experienced by the teacher or children. The mention of a park breaking apart lacks context and does not include explicit comparisons or links to past, present, or future personal experiences or themes. There are no indicators such as ""Have you ever...?"", ""Remember when we...?"", or any specific time references like ""last night,"" ""yesterday,"" etc., that would suggest a connection being made. Therefore, it does not align with the criteria outlined in the coding manual for making connections.
Step 2:"
33301,T,"Dani, can you think of a time when you were blamed for something you did not do? Tell me about it.",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance encourages making a connection to a personal experience, specifically asking for a recollection of a past event where the student felt unjustly blamed. It directly invites the student to reflect and share a personal story, aligning with the ""Making Connections"" code criteria. The question uses a personal pronoun and prompts a recall of a specific event, fitting the guidelines of linking to personal experiences or events in the past.
Step 2:"
33306,T,Where would you keep them?,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not display any of the keywords or notes related to making connections. It lacks explicit or implicit links to personal experiences, predictions of future events, or connections to other media, cultural products, or classroom themes. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for the Making Connections code.
Step 2:"
444001,C,We should place signs in the water because I always see signs in water.,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not explicitly make a link or comparison between text and personal experiences using the key phrases or possible keywords outlined in the coding manual. There's no direct indication of connecting to personal experiences, future plans, or cultural products, nor does it tie back to a classroom or school's unit of study. The statement is more of an assertion based on observed facts rather than a personal connection. 
Step 2:"
33301,T,So how would you help decrease that?,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not feature explicit keywords or phrases from the coding manual such as ""Have you ever…?"", ""This is like when we…"", or any reference to personal experiences or events. Without context, it's not clear if this is connected to a personal experience, future planning, or making connections to books, media, or cultural themes. It appears to be a general inquiry without indicating a direct link to personal experiences or explicit comparisons to text. 
Step 2:"
33302,T,"Are you unique because you're super, super tall or because you’re super, super short?",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not incorporate any of the keywords or key phrases outlined in the coding manual for the ""Making Connections"" code. Although it poses a question to the listener, it does not explicitly make a connection to personal experiences, other books, media, cultural products, or the classroom/school’s theme/unit of study in a manner described by the code. The question seems aimed at identity or characteristics rather than experiences or events. 
Step 2:"
33303,T,"So, can you tell me umm, what can you do to distinguish your bookbag from others that look like it?  ",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance prompts the listener to make a connection between their personal experience and a current situation or problem, specifically regarding distinguishing their bookbag from others. It invokes reflection on past, present, or future personal actions or plans (e.g., tagging, customizing) to solve a personal issue, fitting within the ""Making Connections"" code criteria. It directly encourages recalling or planning personal experiences related to their bookbag, aligning with the code's emphasis on connecting to personal experiences or actions. 
Step 2:"

It narrates an event but does not make explicit or implicit connections to personal experiences, future events, or cultural products relevant to the teacher or children. 
Step 2:"
444011,C,"Cause I mostly watched the altar boys, which is a YouTube channel, and...",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance meets the criteria for the Making Connections code because it explicitly mentions a personal experience with media (a YouTube channel). The reference to ""the altar boys"" YouTube channel is a direct connection to a cultural product experienced personally by the speaker. According to the code notes, connections to media or cultural products that are directly experienced by the teacher or children fit within this code. 
Step 2:"
444001,C,I wash my clothes with cold water and it comes out cold.,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not contain any keywords or key phrases listed in the coding manual for Making Connections. It does not make a link or comparison to personal experiences, other books, media, cultural products, or the classroom/school's theme/unit of study in a manner described by the code notes.

It involves considering past experiences with similar situations or planning for future actions, which relates directly to personal experiences/events in the future as noted in the code notes. 
Step 2:"
