Speaker,Teacher (T) or Child (C) Script (S),Utterance/Idea Units,Code,Predictions_Forecast Explanation
33308,T,How we how will an animal feel when released into the wild after being strapped.,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance meets the criteria for the Predictions/Forecast code because it asks for a prediction about the feelings of an animal in a specific future scenario, which implies anticipating how an event (releasing an animal into the wild) will impact the animal's emotional state. It does not merely use ""going to"" without a specific prediction but rather asks for an inference on a future state of being, aligning with the manual's definition of seeking to understand future events or changes. 
Step 2:"
33303,T,"Yeah, that’s a perfect example, umm, so, so, what would it look like if that problem were to decrease? ",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance implies a scenario of change in the future concerning a problem's magnitude. It invites speculation on the outcomes or effects if a specific problem were to decrease, aligning with predictions about future states. The inquiry focuses on visualizing the consequences or the chain of events following a hypothetical reduction of a problem, fitting into the realm of forecasting future scenarios based on a change. This matches the criteria of making predictions or forecasts about future events, as it prompts for a forecast about the state of a problem, which is a causal chain into the future.
Step 2:"
33308,T,What if you wash them maybe by hand.,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not meet the criteria for the Predictions/Forecast code. It does not make an inference on a forecasted causal chain into the future, nor does it predict new plans for a character or ask what event will happen next. It suggests an action without predicting a specific outcome or providing reasoning for a predicted future event.
Step 2:"
33308,T,Would that help?,X,"Step 1:#### The utterance ""Would that help?"" does not contain any explicit or implied predictions or forecasts about future events or plans of characters. It is a question that seeks to confirm or ask about the efficacy of an action rather than predicting an outcome. It lacks the keywords, phrases, or the necessary structure outlined in the coding manual for a Prediction/Forecast, such as expecting, anticipating, or making specific references to what will happen next or might happen in the future.
Step 2:"
444001,C,"They will be surprised, happy even they might run off.",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance contains elements of a forecast, as indicated by the use of ""will be surprised, happy even they might run off,"" which aligns with the code definition focusing on inferences on a forecasted causal chain into the future. It suggests a specific prediction about how characters will feel and behave (surprised, happy, run off) in reaction to future events, which fits the criteria outlined in the coding manual for Predictions/Forecast. 
Step 2:"
33304,T,Is there a problem in your Community that you will like to help decrease?,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not include keywords or phrases related to predictions/forecast such as ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""will happen next,"" or ""could happen next."" It does not involve a prediction about a future event or a forecasted causal chain. Instead, it asks about a person's willingness to engage in community improvement, which does not align with making predictions about future events or outcomes. 
Step 2:"
33306,T,What would you do if you won a rophy?,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance prompts the respondent to think about a hypothetical future event and consider actions they would take as a result. It meets the predictive element of the criteria by asking for a plan or action following a specific event, aligning with the definition of making inferences on a future scenario. However, it does not use the keywords explicitly mentioned in the manual; it still implicitly asks for a prediction about what one would do next, fitting the broader interpretation of forecasting future actions.
Step 2:"
444001,C,"Thats gonna happen to us, we.",X,"Step 1:#### The utterance ""Thats gonna happen to us, we"" contains the phrase ""gonna happen"" which might suggest a future event. However, according to the coding manual, the phrase ""going to/gonna"" on its own is not sufficient for the Predictions/Forecast code. The utterance lacks a clear, explicit statement of what is expected to happen next, making it vague and not meeting the full criteria outlined for predictions or forecasts, including an explicit statement of future events or plans. 
Step 2:"
33301,T,"Maybe the sea could be dangerous, right?",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance contains an implicit prediction about the sea being dangerous. It suggests a forecasted future state of the sea without directly using keywords or phrases typically associated with making predictions, such as ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" or ""will happen next."" However, the structure of the sentence implies an inference or consideration of the sea's future state, aligning with the spirit of making predictions as outlined in the coding manual. The question form does not negate the predictive nature but rather invites consideration of a possible future scenario, meeting the criteria for engaging in predictive thinking.
Step 2:"
444023,C,"But then some, some of them might die from freeze.",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance contains a predictive element regarding the outcome for ""some of them,"" implying a forecast that these subjects (implicitly plants or creatures) could potentially die from freezing conditions. The phrase ""might die from freeze"" aligns with making a prediction about a possible future event, specifically anticipating a negative outcome based on an environmental condition. The prediction is clear and presents an expected causal chain of events (freezing leading to death), which is in line with the coding manual's definition for predictions/forecast, including anticipating what could happen next.
Step 2:"
33302:,T,What can you do to control the invasive germ that causes the flu when you are sick?,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not meet the criteria for the Predictions/Forecast code as it focuses on asking for methods to control an invasive germ rather than making or soliciting predictions about future events or outcomes related to the characters or events. The keywords or phrases associated with making predictions, such as ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" or ""will happen next,"" are not present. Instead, this question seeks practical advice or knowledge about handling a situation, which does not align with making predictions or forecasting future events. 
Step 2:"
33304,T,"Dani, what can you do to prevent your clothes from shrinking when you wash them?",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not include keywords or phrases related to predictions or forecasts such as expect, anticipate, will happen next, or could happen next. Instead, it asks for preventative measures or advice regarding clothes shrinking, which is more aligned with seeking practical solutions or advice rather than making a future-oriented prediction or forecast. The coding manual emphasizes keywords and scenarios that involve predicting future events or outcomes, which is not the focus of this utterance.
Step 2:"
444025:,C,"Umm, I could stay home drink medicine and don't uh...",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not contain keywords or phrases associated with predictions or forecasting as outlined in the coding manual. It seems to be a speculative statement about personal actions rather than a predictive inference about future events or plans of characters. The utterance lacks an explicit statement of what will happen next or a forecasted causal chain into the future.
Step 2:"
444023,C,They have two 200 and there's some little day or like month or year they decrease.,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not meet the criteria for the Predictions/Forecast code. While it mentions a change over time (""decrease""), it lacks any explicit statement or inquiry regarding a forecasted causal chain into the future, predictions about specific events that will happen next, or any rationale for such a prediction. It appears to describe an observation or trend rather than making a prediction about future events or plans. 
Step 2:"
444023:,C,"Oh, don't let pet owners are release them into the into the Everglades.",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not contain elements of making predictions or forecasts about future events or outcomes based on the coding manual criteria. It seems more like a cautionary statement rather than a prediction or a forecast about what might happen next or in the future. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a Predictions/Forecast code as it lacks keywords or phrases related to expecting, anticipating, or predicting future events or outcomes.
Step 2:"
33304:,T,What can you do to prevent this from happening? ,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not contain explicit keywords associated with the Predictions/Forecast code such as ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""will happen next,"" or similar phrases that would suggest a focus on forecasting a causal chain into the future. Instead, it asks for measures or actions to prevent a certain event, which aligns more with problem-solving or prevention strategies rather than making a prediction about future events or outcomes. 
Step 2:"
33308,T,It will come back eventually.,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not meet the criteria for the Predictions/Forecast code as it lacks an explicit statement of what will happen next or any specifics about the future. There's a vague reference to something returning, but without a clear, forecasted causal chain or details about future events or plans, it does not align with the code requirements. The utterance does not contain keywords or phrases indicative of predicting such as “expect,” “anticipate,” or “will happen next,” nor does it explain the rationale behind such a prediction. The statement is too general and lacks context or specificity to be considered a prediction under the guidelines provided in the coding manual.
Step 2:"
33306,T,What would you do if you won a trophy?,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance meets the criteria for the Predictions/Forecast code as it explicitly asks for a prediction about a future event or plan (winning a trophy) and what actions would be taken in response. It encourages the respondent to think about and articulate a hypothetical future scenario, fitting the definition and purpose of making a prediction or forecast. 
Step 2:"
33304,T,"So, what can you do to prevent your clothes from shrinking when you wash them?",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance encourages the recipients to think ahead about actions that could prevent a specific outcome, in this case, clothes shrinking after being washed. It implicitly asks for a prediction about preventive measures, aligning with the essence of the prediction/forecast code. Even though it does not use the exact keywords or phrases from the coding manual, it embodies the principle of forecasting by expecting a response that would detail a planned action to avert an undesirable result. However, it slightly deviates from the coding manual's emphasis on causal chains into the future or predicting new plans for characters and specific events. The focus here is on practical, preventative advice rather than a narrative prediction or forecast. 
Step 2:"
33304:,T,Could you live under the sea? ,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not contain keywords or phrases related to making predictions or forecasting future events. Instead, it poses a hypothetical question about the ability to live under the sea, which does not necessarily infer a forecasted causal chain into the future or predict new plans for a character. There is no explicit statement of expectation, anticipation, or prediction of what will happen next. Therefore, it does not meet the specific criteria outlined for the Predictions/Forecast code.
