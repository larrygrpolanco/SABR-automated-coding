33308,T,What do you think the animals will feel free and confused when they're released?,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance indirectly meets the criteria for the Causal Effects & Problem Solving code. It prompts for an inference (thinking about feelings of animals upon their release), which indirectly asks for an explanation of the consequences/effects (“feel free and confused”) related to a specific action/event (being released). Although it does not explicitly use keywords from the manual, it engages with causal reasoning by asking for the emotional consequences for the animals due to the event of their release, aligning with the aspect of referencing antecedents or consequences/effects of text events under the Causal Effects notes.
Step 2:"
33308,T,How we how will an animal feel when released into the wild after being strapped.,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance seems to indirectly engage with causal effects and problem-solving through an inquiry into the consequences (affects on animals) of an event (being released into the wild after being restrained). It posits a scenario that involves understanding the potential mental states (feelings) of animals as an effect of their release, which could be inferred as exploring the mental causality. However, the utterance lacks explicit causal or problem-solving keywords as outlined in the manual but implies a causal relationship by questioning the effect (the animal's feelings) of a cause (release after being strapped). The inference requires understanding the causal chain between the event (release) and its consequence on the animal's mental state, albeit indirectly.  
Step 2:"
33302:,T,"Maybe they're being reunited with their family after the release, and that makes them feel very happy. ",1,"Step 1:#### The utterance explicitly links an event (being reunited with family after release) with a consequence (feeling very happy) using causal reasoning, highlighting a direct cause (reunion with family) and its effect on emotional state (happiness). This directly aligns with the causal effects criteria of identifying and explaining antecedents and consequences of events or states, especially referencing mental causality which explains the antecedents and consequences of mental states (in this case, happiness).
Step 2:"
444011,C,Really angry because they're taking away...,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance implicitly contains a causal keyword ""because"" which suggests a causal relationship between an event (""they're taking away"") and the emotional state of being ""Really angry."" According to the coding manual, causal effects reference antecedents or consequences/effects of text events or physical states/objects, and this utterance explicitly mentions the cause of an emotional state, aligning with the notes on identifying and explaining antecedents and consequences of mental states. 
Step 2:"
444001,C,They feel confused because they probably feel confused because confused because they they didn't understand why they like caught them and release them back.,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance involves explaining a cause-and-effect relationship, using ""because"" to directly link the feeling of confusion to not understanding the rationale behind an action (caught and release). The repeated use of ""confused"" emphasizes the causal connection between the action/event described and the emotional response. It goes beyond stating an effect by attempting to justify why the confusion exists, which aligns with the code's criterion of explaining the how/why of things including cause/effect as well as identifying and explaining antecedents and consequences of mental states. 
Step 2:"
33304:,T,And why do you think you would feel happy?,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance prompts an explanation of the cause of an emotional state, specifically happiness. It directly asks for the reasoning (why) behind feeling a certain way, aligning with the causal effects and problem-solving criteria which include asking for or explaining the how/why of things including cause/effect. The keyword ""why"" explicitly invites an inference on a causal chain between a mental state (feeling happy) and its antecedent, making it relevant under the code's definition.
Step 2:"
33301,T,"Dani, how would an animal feel when released into the wild after being trapped somewhere?",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance prompts for the inference about the feelings of an animal being released into the wild after being trapped, which encourages thinking about the emotional consequences (a form of effect) of the event of release. However, the direct focus is on exploring emotions rather than explaining a causal chain of events or problem-solving process. The keywords related to causal effects or problem solving are not present, and the utterance primarily seeks an examination of an animal's feelings—a consequence without directly addressing the causal or problem-solving elements outlined in the coding manual.
Step 2:"
33302:,T,How would an animal feel when released into the wild after being trapped somewhere?,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance prompts an inference about the emotional state of an animal being released into the wild after being trapped, which aligns with references to mental causality by exploring the antecedents and consequences of mental states as outlined in the code notes. Although the utterance does not use explicit causal or problem-solving keywords, it implicitly asks for an explanation of the effect (animal's feeling) of a specific cause (being released after being trapped), thereby meeting the criteria for causal effects and problem solving by asking for an explanation of the how/why of the emotional outcome.
Step 2:"
33308,T,What do you think the animals will feel free but confused when they're released?,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance involves considering the future mental states of animals upon being released, which implies a causal relationship between their release and their subsequent feelings of freedom and confusion. It asks for an inference about the cause (release) resulting in effects (feeling free but confused). This falls under explaining the how/why of mental states as a consequence of an event, which aligns with the guidelines for identifying causal effects and problem solving, specifically under references to mental causality and explaining the justification/reasoning behind an inference.
Step 2:"
33302:,T,How would an animal feel when released into the wild after being trapped somewhere?,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance prompts a discussion about the consequences (feelings of an animal) following an event (being released into the wild after being trapped), which aligns with the definition of Causal Effects & Problem Solving code criteria by addressing the effects and mental states as a consequence of an event. The use of ""how would"" asks for an inference about the animal's feelings, which is a cause-and-effect reasoning regarding the animal's mental state after being released. This aligns with the code notes on discussing the effects or outcomes (in this case, feelings) resulting from a specific antecedent (being released from being trapped).
Step 2:"
33303,T,"So, now is there a problem in your community that you would like to help decrease? ",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance prompts the identification of a problem within a community and expresses an interest in contributing towards decreasing the problem. It aligns with the problem-solving aspect of the coding manual, particularly under discussing to identify a problem or solution and describing obstacles or problems faced by character/self/others. Although it does not directly use problem-solving keywords, the implication of identifying and intending to decrease a problem fits within the broader context of discussing ways to solve problems or reach goals.
Step 2:"
33304:,T,"Ok, why do you like to settle down and relax at the couch?",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance meets the criteria for the Causal Effects & Problem Solving code because it uses the keyword ""why"" to ask for an explanation of a causal relationship between the action of settling down and relaxing on the couch and the reasons behind this preference. It asks for the reasoning or justification behind the preference, which aligns with the code notes emphasizing asking for or explaining the how/why of things, including cause/effect relationships.
Step 2:"
33304,T,"So Dani, is there a problem in your Community that you would like to help to decrease?",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance prompts an identification of a problem within a community context, indicating an intent to discuss or acknowledge a problem that exists and explore potential ways to decrease it. The use of ""problem"" aligns with the Problem Solving keywords in the coding manual. The utterance indirectly seeks to engage in a discussion about possible solutions to a community issue, which is a core aspect of problem-solving. The question is explicitly designed to initiate thinking about challenges within a community and how one might contribute to remedying such situations, even though it does not directly use causal keywords or delve into specific cause-and-effect relationships.
Step 2:"
33301,T,"Dani, is there a problem in your community that you would like to help decrease?",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not contain explicit keywords relating to causal effects or problem solving as defined in the coding manual. However, it implicitly addresses the aspect of identifying a problem by asking if there is a problem in the community that the subject would like to help decrease. This implies a setup for discussing a problem and potentially leading into problem-solving discussions, even though it doesn't explicitly involve causal reasoning or the problem-solving process itself.
Step 2:"
33301,T,So that's a problem in your community that you would like to help decrease?,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance implies a discussion around identifying a problem in a community that someone wishes to address, which aligns with the ""Problem Solving"" aspect of the coding criteria. Specifically, the utterance is about acknowledging a problem and the speaker's desire to contribute to its decrease, thus fitting the criterion of discussing ways to solve problems or reach goals.
Step 2:"
33303,T,How do we like do with that problem? ,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance implies a discussion about addressing an unspecified problem, suggested by the use of the word ""problem"" and the phrase ""How do we...?"" Although it does not contain detailed action words or specific keywords related to solutions, the general inquiry into dealing with a problem aligns with the Problem Solving notes in the coding manual that mention discussing ways to solve problems. While not explicitly mentioning a solution or a problem-solving strategy, the utterance opens a dialogue for potential problem-solving discussions. 
Step 2:"
33302,T,"Okay, what’s the problem that you wanna decrease by fixing the park?",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance directly involves discussing a problem that needs to be addressed (""the problem that you wanna decrease"") and mentions an action intended to address or fix the problem (""fixing the park""). The keywords ""problem"" and ""fix"" align with the coding manual's criteria for ""Problem Solving"" as it describes obstacles or problems being faced and discusses ways these might be solved. The utterance clearly indicates an attempt to identify a problem and explore a solution, which meets the criteria for coding under ""Causal Effects & Problem Solving.""
Step 2:"
33302,T,Is there a problem in your community that you would like to help decrease?,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance prompts the identification of a problem within a community and expresses a desire to contribute towards decreasing it. It aligns with the problem-solving criteria by asking to describe obstacles or problems faced by others. The phrase ""like to help decrease"" implies looking for solutions to identified problems, which matches the discussion aspect of finding solutions or ways to mitigate issues as outlined in the coding manual under problem-solving notes. 
Step 2:"
33308,T,"Yeah, because that's their habitat, right?",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance contains the causal keyword ""because,"" indicating a reason for a previous statement. The speaker is explaining the rationale behind an assertion, which aligns with the causal effects portion of the coding criteria, specifically under explaining the justification or reasoning behind an inference (why an emotion was inferred; why my judgment is correct). The utterance implies a causal chain by justifying why something is the way it is, tying back to a habitat being necessary for survival.
Step 2:"
33304:,T,Would you not be nonnative under the sea?,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not contain any explicit keywords related to causal effects, problem solving, or their related possible keywords as outlined in the coding manual. The question is hypothetical and does not directly involve causal reasoning, identification of problems, solutions, or any causal or problem-solving process. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for applying the ""Causal Effects & Problem Solving"" code.
