This aligns with the coding manual's definition of cognition, which includes making explicit references to cognitive processes through keywords such as ""think."" Therefore, based on the analysis of the presence of the keyword and the directives from the code notes, the utterance meets the criteria for the cognition code.
Step 2:"
33304:,T,"Umm, so Dani, can you think of any other exotic animals that live on Earth?",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance explicitly asks someone to engage in a cognitive process, specifically to ""think"" of other exotic animals that exist on Earth. The keyword ""think"" directly relates to the cognition code as it signifies an explicit reference to a cognitive process. It invites the individual to recall or imagine different animals, which are aspects covered under the definition of the Cognition code. The use of this keyword supports the utterance's alignment with the criteria for the Cognition code. 
Step 2:"
33301,T,"So Dani, we learned there can be dry and humid regions in the Everglades.",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance includes the keyword ""learned"" which indicates a reference to a cognitive process, in this case, the acquisition of knowledge about the Everglades' climate. The criteria for the Cognition code are met as the utterance explicitly references a cognitive process through the use of a keyword identified in the coding manual.
Step 2:"
33304:,T,Can you think of something that you would like to have large amounts of?,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance uses the keyword ""think,"" which falls under the cognition code according to the coding manual. It prompts an individual to engage in a cognitive process to identify something they would desire in large amounts. This actively involves thinking about preferences and choices, which aligns with the definition of indicating explicit reference to cognitive processes. The use of the word ""think"" explicitly asks for engaging in cognition, which meets the criteria outlined in the coding manual for this code.
Step 2:"
33302,T,"Yeah, how do you think cold water prevents them from shrinking?",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance contains the keyword ""think,"" which relates directly to cognitive processes. The sentence is focused on eliciting the cognitive process of reasoning or hypothesizing about the effect of cold water on preventing shrinkage. The focus on what the speaker or listener ""thinks"" about a specific process aligns with the code criteria of indicating explicit reference to cognitive processes. Hence, it matches the coding manual's guidelines for the Cognition code, as it asks for an explicit engagement with a cognitive process (thinking) about a particular phenomenon.
Step 2:"
444011,C,I can't really think of something.,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance contains the keyword ""think,"" which indicates an explicit reference to a cognitive process. According to the coding manual, using keywords to describe one's own thinking process is coded under Cognition. Therefore, the presence of ""think"" in the statement ""I can't really think of something"" meets the criteria for Cognition, as it expresses the speaker's mental process of trying to conceive an idea or remember something.
Step 2:"
33304,T,Think about one thing that you can do that anyone else can do.,1,"Step 1:#### The utterance involves the use of the keyword ""Think,"" which indicates an explicit reference to cognitive processes according to the coding manual. The prompt encourages the individual to engage in an internal cognitive process to identify an action that is universally achievable. This aligns with the code notes that specify naming or describing one's own cognition and the use of keywords to describe thinking processes as criteria for the Cognition code.
Step 2:"
444015,C,I don't really don‚Äôt know.,X,"Step 1:#### The utterance contains a phrase ""I don't really don't know"" which might seem to contain a keyword related to cognition (""know""). However, according to the code notes, formulaic responses like ""I don't know"" are explicitly excluded from this coding category. Despite the double negation likely being a typographical error, the essence of the statement aligns with ""I don't know,"" which is mentioned as an example of what not to code under this category.
Step 2:"
444025:,C,Because the teacher said I know it was you that did it. ,1,"Step 1:#### The utterance contains the keyword ""know,"" which indicates an explicit reference to a cognitive process, specifically to a state of awareness or understanding. This aligns with the coding manual’s definition of the Cognition code that marks the explicit reference to cognitive processes. The usage of ""know"" in this context is a direct indication of the speaker’s (in this case, the teacher's) statement about their own cognitive state, pertaining to certainty or awareness about someone’s actions. Therefore, it meets the criteria for coding under Cognition according to the notes that state using keywords to describe teachers/students own thinking is also coded here. 
Step 2:"
444001,C,I don't know.,X,"Step 1:#### The utterance ""I don't know."" is a formulaic response that the coding manual explicitly excludes from the Cognition code. Despite technically involving a cognitive process (not knowing), the manual guides that such formulaic responses do not meet the criteria for coding as Cognition. 
Step 2:"
33308,T,What do we learn about the mammals in the Everglades?,1,"Step 1:#### The utterance prompts a discussion or response involving acquiring knowledge ('learn') about mammals in a specific location (the Everglades), which directly involves the cognitive process of gaining information or understanding. The keyword ""learn"" matches the coding manual's listed keywords for indicating explicit reference to cognitive processes. The utterance meets the criteria for the Cognition code as it inherently suggests engaging in the process of learning, which is a cognitive activity.
Step 2:"
444023:,C,"I think they eat their self in, but I think they don't say that in here but I think they eat themselves some people and they compete the compete for the food.",1,"Step 1:#### The utterance contains multiple instances of the keyword ""think,"" indicating that the speaker is reflecting on their cognition regarding what they believe about the subject matter. The repeated use of ""think"" shows an active engagement in the cognitive process of considering or theorizing about the behavior of the subjects discussed. This aligns with the coding manual's criteria, which includes naming or describing cognition and making inferences about mental processes using the provided keywords. The utterance clearly demonstrates the speaker's process of thinking and attempting to understand or figure out the situation, which meets the criteria for the Cognition code.
Step 2:"
33302,T,Can you think of a creature that is no longer in existence?,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance involves the direct use of the keyword ""think,"" indicating an explicit reference to the cognitive process of considering or pondering. The question prompts cognitive engagement by asking someone to recall or imagine creatures that are no longer in existence, thereby involving memory and perhaps knowledge or imagination, all of which are related to cognition. The use of ""think"" in this context aligns with the code notes on naming or describing cognition, as well as utilizing keywords to describe one's own thinking process. 
Step 2:"
33306,T,That way you know. Ohh.,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not meet the criteria for the Cognition code because although it contains the keyword ""know,"" it is used in a very brief, informal context without explicitly referencing or indicating a cognitive process. The utterance is too vague and lacks clear reference to thought or cognitive processes as described in the coding manual.
Step 2:"
33301,T,Do you know somewhere in the United States where there are mountains?,1,"Step 1:#### The given utterance contains the keyword ""know,"" which indicates an explicit reference to cognitive processes. According to the coding manual, using keywords to describe individuals' own thinking is coded under Cognition. Additionally, the utterance is asking for an explicit piece of knowledge, which fits the criteria for indicating cognitive processing as it pertains to recalling or knowing specific information.
Step 2:"
33304:,T,Think about it and then tell me a little bit about what happened.,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance meets the criteria for the Cognition code because it explicitly uses the keyword ""think."" It encourages the listener or reader to engage in a cognitive process (thinking) about an event before discussing it. The phrase ""think about it"" directly points to an internal cognitive process regarding recalling or understanding an event before verbalizing it. According to the code notes, using keywords to describe one's own thinking or encouraging others to engage in thinking falls under this code.
Step 2:"
444001,C,"I know XXX, I'm funny.",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance includes the keyword ""know,"" indicating an explicit reference to a cognitive process. The speaker is stating a self-awareness of a character trait, which is a direct reference to their own cognition. According to the code notes, using keywords to describe one's own thinking or awareness is coded under Cognition. The presence of ""know"" as a cognitive process keyword confirms the applicability of this code.
Step 2:"
33304:,T,Can you remember if any of your friends have been through that? ,1,"Step 1:#### The utterance ""Can you remember if any of your friends have been through that?"" directly falls under the criteria of the Cognition code due to the explicit use of the keyword ""remember,"" which indicates a reference to cognitive processes. The sentence aims at retrieving information or experiences from memory regarding the listener's friends, actively engaging the cognitive process of recalling or remembering past events. 
Step 2:"
33304:,T,"Umm, maybe you think about?",1,"Step 1:#### The utterance includes the keyword ""think,"" indicating an invitation or suggestion to engage in the cognitive process of thinking. The use of ""think"" here prompts someone to consider or ponder, which aligns with the coding manual's definition of referencing cognitive processes. This aligns with the criteria for the Cognition code as it explicitly involves a cognitive verb in the form of a question or suggestion, indicating an active mental process. 
Step 2:"
33308,T,You don't know.,X,"Step 1:#### The utterance ""You don't know."" is a direct statement that does not contain any keywords from the coding manual related to the cognition code. Although it suggests a lack of knowledge, which is related to cognitive processes, the manual explicitly excludes formulaic responses like ""I don’t know"" which closely aligns with the given utterance. Therefore, based on the code notes and the exclusion criteria, this utterance does not contain explicit reference to cognitive processes as defined by the coding manual.
