444001,C,"They, uh. They like they they like, his color is messed up and then they don't let him inside.",1,"Step 1:#### The utterance implies a judgment about someone based on ""his color is messed up,"" which could reflect an opinion or attitude towards an individual's appearance. The mention of not letting someone inside because of this reason suggests a judgment or perspective about the person's acceptability based on appearance. This aligns with the code's definition of expressing character/self/others' judgments about traits/identity of someone, aligning with keywords related to judgments about identity and quality such as ""acceptable"" or ""inadequate,"" although these specific words are not used. The judgment is inferred through the context of the situation described. 
Step 2:"
33308,T,That makes you unique and special from everyone else.,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance includes a judgment about the identity of the listener, specifically highlighting unique and special traits that differentiate them from others. The statement implies a positive assessment of the listener's identity, aligning with the ""Judgments/Perspectives"" code criteria, which requires the expression of opinions or attitudes that pass judgment on the traits or identity of someone. The use of ""unique"" and ""special"" can be linked to expressing attitudes about someone's identity, thus meeting the criteria for this code.
Step 2:"
33308,T,That's true.,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not contain any keywords or express opinions, attitudes, or assertions that relate to character/self/others' judgments about the quality of something or traits/identity of someone. It merely acknowledges a statement as correct without expressing any judgments, perspectives, or attitudes that are specifically highlighted in the coding manual. There's a lack of context or content that would enable the application of the ""Judgments/Perspectives"" code according to the provided coding rules.
Step 2:"
33302,T,"Yeah, that’s a really good idea.",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance includes an expression of a positive opinion or attitude, which aligns with the coding manual's criteria for the Judgments/Perspectives code by using the keyword ""good"". It exhibits a judgment about the quality of an idea, reflecting a personal or other’s perspective or attitude towards the stimulus or state mentioned. This statement passes a positive judgment or shows approval, fitting within the definitions outlined for judging the qualities of concepts or actions.
Step 2:"
33302:,T,"Yep, great example. ",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not clearly meet the criteria defined in the Judgments/Perspectives code from the coding manual. The utterance ""Yep, great example."" does not contain any specific keywords related to identity, quality, persuasion, or possible attempts in the context of making judgments or expressing a perspective on character, traits, or quality of something or someone. It appears to be a simple acknowledgment or approval without a detailed judgment or perspective being shared. The code notes emphasize the need for the discussion or statement to pass judgment or compare perspectives, neither of which is evidently present in this utterance upon initial analysis. 
Step 2:"
444022,C,It could be...,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not clearly meet the criteria for Judgments/Perspectives code because it lacks any specific keywords, judgments, or perspectives as per the coding manual provided. The phrase ""It could be..."" is too vague without further context or content and does not express any definitive opinions, attitudes, or assertions that could reflect a judgment or perspective about the quality of something or the traits/identity of someone. It is an example of a modal verb phrase indicating possibility, which by itself does not constitute a judgment or perspective without additional qualifying information.
Step 2:"
33301,T,When they compete with food with them for them means like they don't like hunting the same thing as the panther like making it like less popular.,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance includes the expression of a perspective or attitude towards the competition for food, likening it to disliking the act of hunting the same prey as a panther and suggesting an impact on the prey's popularity. The keywords or phrases indicating judgments or perspectives could be inferred from the context as it discusses preferences and impacts (i.e., ""don't like""), which points to an opinion about the situation described. Moreover, it implicitly contains a judgment about the behavior (competing for food) and its consequences (making it less popular), relating to the attitudes about the situation or the entities involved. This analysis suggests that the utterance contains an opinion which affects or describes the qualities or traits of the subjects (the competitors and the panther) and possibly the quality of the act (the hunting competition making prey less popular).
Step 2:"
33304:,T,"Right, so be a responsible pet owner, right? ",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance suggests a judgment or an assertion related to the behavior expected of pet owners, indicating an opinion on what constitutes responsible behavior. The repetition of ""right?"" appears to seek agreement or validation of this view, aligning with persuasion keywords such as ""agree"" by implying a correct way to act towards pets. However, it doesn't explicitly use identity, quality, or most persuasion keywords as listed in the manual, and it doesn't clearly pass judgment on a character trait, identity, or quality of something or someone. It is rather a directive masked as an opinion, making it borderline for coders. The judgment here is implied rather than directly stated or elaborated upon, making it a nuanced case for coding under Judgments/Perspectives. 
Step 2:"
33304,T,It could be at your school.,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not clearly include keywords or follow the specific coding notes for Judgments/Perspectives. There is no explicit mention of opinions, attitudes, or assertions that reflect on the quality or traits of something or someone, nor does it contain discernible persuasion keywords. The utterance is ambiguous without a clear context indicating a judgment or perspective on identity, quality, or persuasion. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for this specific code.  
Step 2:"
33303,T,"Is that when you distinguish yourself, you also can make yourself unique, slightly different meanings, right?",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance involves the discussion of identity (""distinguish yourself,"" ""make yourself unique"") which falls under the ""identity keywords"" section of the coding manual. It is an assertion that expresses a judgment about the traits or identity of someone, specifically concerning individual uniqueness and distinction. The utterance does not directly use the listed keywords but clearly conveys an opinion about personal identity and how specific actions (distinguishing oneself) can affect one's uniqueness. The concepts of ""unique"" and ""distinguish"" can be linked to judgments about the self, fitting the code's definition of expressing character, self, or other’s judgments about traits or identity.
Step 2:"
33308,T,"Yes, that's a problem we should help decrease, your right.",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance contains elements that could be aligned with the Judgments/Perspectives code because the speaker expresses an agreement with someone else's perspective (""your right"") and acknowledges a problem that should be addressed (""that's a problem we should help decrease""). The agreement suggests a shared judgment or perspective on the issue, fitting with the criteria of expressing attitudes or assertions that reflect a judgment about a state or situation. The use of ""should"" indicates an opinion on what actions are supposed to take place, meeting the definition of judgments/perspectives by including a quality keyword that reflects a judgment about how to respond to a situation.
Step 2:"
444001,C,Even though he was raining and there's like a bad storm coming.,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not contain keywords or phrases that directly express judgments, perspectives, or opinions as defined by the coding manual. The phrase describes a weather condition without any explicit judgment or opinion about the quality of something, the traits/identity of someone, or expressing attitudes about a stimulus/state. It primarily gives a factual description without using judgment or persuasion keywords, nor does it reference character/self/other's judgments or perspectives. 
Step 2:"
33302:,T,"Uhm, yeah, great, great point. ",X,"Step 1:#### The utterance does not contain any of the specific keywords related to judgments, perspectives, or qualities as outlined in the coding manual. It appears to be an affirmation of a point made previously, without expressing an opinion, attitude, or assertion that passes judgment on the quality of something or someone's traits/identity. There's no indication of any discussion or statement that passes judgment on someone/something in terms of common judgments such as morality, beauty, intelligence, etc. Thus, the utterance lacks the elements described in the code notes for ""Judgments/Perspectives."" 
Step 2:"
33308,T,That's true.,X,"Step 1:#### The utterance does not contain any judgments, perspectives, or any specific keywords from the coding manual that would indicate an expression of character/self/other’s judgments, attitudes, or opinions. It simply acknowledges the truth of a preceding statement without providing any further judgment or perspective.
Step 2:"
444001,C,I think we should.,X,"Step 1:#### The utterance ""I think we should"" expresses an opinion, which aligns with the criteria for the Judgments/Perspectives code. It reflects a personal perspective regarding a course of action, indicating a judgment or attitude about what is considered an appropriate next step. However, without specific context or further elaboration, it's difficult to determine if it directly applies to character/self/other judgments about the quality of something or traits/identity of someone. The utterance is borderline as it reflects a perspective but lacks detailed content to fully align with the deeper aspects of the code related to judgments on quality, traits, or identity.
Step 2:"
33303,T,"So, what is one thing that makes you unique from everyone else?",1,"Step 1:#### The utterance prompts an exploration of individual identity, encouraging the respondent to reflect on personal traits or qualities that distinguish them from others. This aligns with the Judgment/Perspectives code, particularly under identity keywords and the discussion of traits/identity. The question explicitly asks for a self-judgment on uniqueness, which falls directly into categorizing personal identity and perspectives, fitting the criteria outlined in the coding manual.
Step 2:"
33308,T,"See, because it's unique.",1,"Step 1:#### The utterance ""See, because it's unique."" suggests a judgment or perspective about something being unique. The use of the word ""unique"" aligns with the coding manual's criteria of expressing attitudes or assertions that convey judgments about the quality of something. This fits under the criteria that include opinions or attitudes about the quality of a stimulus or state, which is part of the ""Judgments/Perspectives"" code. The utterance indicates a positive assessment or valuation (""unique"") of a subject, object, or idea, reflecting an individual's perspective or judgment on its distinctiveness or exceptionality.
Step 2:"
33302,T,Is there a problem in your community that you would like to help decrease?,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not contain any keywords or phrases related directly to expressing judgments, perspectives, opinions, attitudes, or assertions about the quality of something or someone's traits/identity. Instead, it prompts the respondent to think about community issues and whether they feel motivated to address them. The focus is on identifying problems and a willingness to engage in solutions, without providing any judgment or perspective on these problems or the actions required to decrease them. 
Step 2:"
33304:,T,Why is that bad for the Everglades?,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance asks for a judgment or evaluation (""Why is that bad"") about the condition or status of the Everglades, which matches with the criteria of seeking an opinion or perspective on the quality of something. The use of the keyword ""bad"" directly invites an assessment or judgment regarding the impact on the Everglades. The utterance prompts a discussion or explanation that inherently involves perspective or judgment about the state or effect on the Everglades, aligning with the definition of the Judgments/Perspectives code that seeks to capture assertions expressing judgments about the quality of something.
Step 2:"
33301,T,"Right, so an exotic animal.",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not contain any explicit keywords from the Judgments/Perspectives code related to identity, quality, or persuasion. The term ""exotic"" can suggest a judgment about uncommon or unusual characteristics of an animal but without further context indicating a judgment of quality, trait, or an attitude about the animal, it is not sufficient to conclude that the criteria for the code are met. The utterance lacks a clear expression of opinions, attitudes, or assertions that reflect judgments or perspectives on the character, identity, or quality of someone or something.
