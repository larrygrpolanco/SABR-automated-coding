Speaker,Teacher (T) or Child (C) Script (S),Utterance/Idea Units,Code,Feelings_Emotions Explanation
33308,T,It makes you feel relaxed?,1,"Step 1:#### The utterance explicitly mentions the keyword ""feel relaxed,"" directly indicating an emotional state, matching the criteria within the coding manual for the Feelings/Emotions code. The manual emphasizes coding for instances where emotional states are named or described, which is exactly the case in this utterance.
Step 2:"
33308,T,What do you think the animals will feel free and confused when they're released?,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance meets the criteria for the Feelings/Emotions code as it directly mentions potential emotional states (feel free and confused) that animals might experience upon being released. By discussing the possibility of the animals feeling ""free"" and ""confused,"" it clearly engages with naming or describing emotional or affective states, as outlined in the coding manual. The presence of explicit keywords related to emotions (""feel free"" and ""confused"") matches the manual's guidelines for coding utterances under the Feelings/Emotions category. The utterance involves inference about the animals' emotional states, which according to the code notes, is a valid basis for marking this code regardless of whether the emotional state is explicitly stated or inferred.
Step 2:"
33301,T,"Dani, how do you think a lion would feel when it is captured from the wild?",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance prompts Dani to speculate on the emotional state of a lion when it is captured from the wild. The keywords and code notes from the coding manual direct us to identify and code instances where emotions are either named, described, or inferred regarding oneself, others, or characters. In this case, the utterance clearly aims to elicit a description or naming of the emotional state (likely to be fear, sadness, anger, etc.) of a lion in a specific scenario, which aligns with the criteria for the Feelings/Emotions code. 
Step 2:"
33301,T,It would be able to see its family.,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance indirectly refers to feelings of possibly happiness, contentment, or relief, as implied by the context of being able to see one's family, which generally elicits positive emotions. The sentence implies an emotional state linked with the reunion or connection with family, fitting within the criteria of describing emotional or affective states of characters or individuals. The code notes mention that this code is marked regardless of whether the emotional state was inferred or explicitly stated, allowing for the inclusion of this inferred emotional state.
Step 2:"
444023:,C,"Like there's be, uhm, you'll be uncomfortable cause fish. ",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not directly mention any emotions or feelings as defined by the coding manual. However, ""uncomfortable"" could be considered an emotional state, falling broadly under the keywords related to feelings or vague emotional states. The mention of feeling ""uncomfortable"" implies a form of emotional or affective state, aligning with the code note that states the code is marked regardless of whether the emotional state was inferred or whether it was explicitly stated. The reference to feeling uncomfortable implies a negative emotion, although not explicitly listed like other basic or complex emotions, it fits within the scope of emotions the code aims to capture. 
Step 2:"
33301,T,Yeah.,X,"Step 1:#### The utterance lacks any keywords related to feelings or emotions as outlined in the coding manual. There is no indication of describing any emotional or affective states, nor is there an implication of emotion through mental state language. The utterance is simply an affirmative response without any explicit or implied reference to feelings or emotions.
Step 2:"
33301,T,And then how did you feel when you got blamed?,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance prompts the discussion of feelings/emotions related to being blamed, directly asking about the emotional state following a specific event. The use of the word ""feel"" aligns with the keywords specified in the coding manual for the Feelings/Emotions category. It explicitly requires the respondent to name or describe their emotional or affective state, which meets the criteria for identifying feelings or emotions, whether the emotional state is inferred or explicitly stated. 
Step 2:"
33304:,T,"Happy, right? ",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance directly uses the keyword ""happy"" from the coding manual. The usage of the word ""happy"" clearly indicates the expression of an emotional state, in this case, happiness, which aligns perfectly with the given code definition of capturing feelings/emotions such as happy. Since it names an emotional state directly, it meets the criteria for the Feelings/Emotions code.
Step 2:"
33308,T,How we how will an animal feel when released into the wild after being strapped.,1,"Step 1:#### The utterance prompts consideration of an animal's feelings upon being released into the wild after experiencing restraint, which implies an exploration of emotional or affective states. The reference to how an animal will ""feel"" directly cues the requirement for the Feeling/Emotions code. It suggests a transition from a negative experience (being strapped) to potentially experiencing freedom or relief, thus engaging with emotions such as fear, anxiety, or relief, even though specific emotions are not named explicitly. The coding manual instructs to mark the presence of both inferred and explicitly stated emotional states, guided by mental state language such as ""feel."" Thus, this utterance falls within the ambit of discussing feelings or emotional states, even if hypothetically about an animal, as the coding manual does not limit the consideration of emotions to humans alone.
Step 2:"
33302:,T,"Maybe they're being reunited with their family after the release, and that makes them feel very happy. ",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance explicitly contains a keyword related to feelings/emotions, specifically ""happy"". The utterance describes a scenario where someone feels very happy about being reunited with their family, meeting the criteria for naming or describing emotional or affective states. The emotion of happiness is directly stated in the text, aligning with the code notes that require coding all basic emotions and more intense emotions when they are named or described.
Step 2:"
444025:,C,Happy. ,1,"Step 1:#### The utterance contains the keyword ""Happy,"" which directly matches one of the specific keywords listed in the coding manual under the category of Feelings/Emotions. The manual instructs to code for explicit emotional states, including basic emotions like happiness. Thus, this utterance explicitly meets the coding criteria by directly naming an emotional state. 
Step 2:"
444011,C,Really angry because they're taking away...,1,"Step 1:#### The utterance contains the keyword ""angry"" which directly relates to the feelings/emotions coding criteria. The speaker is expressing a specific emotional state, making it clear that the code for Feelings/Emotions applies. The manual specifies the inclusion of direct statements of emotion which this utterance falls under. 
Step 2:"
444022:,C,Bad.,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not provide enough context to determine if it is referring to an emotional state or is simply an adjective describing something unrelated to emotions or feelings. The keyword ""bad"" could potentially indicate a negative emotional state if additional context were provided that aligned with the coding manual's definition regarding negative emotions or feelings. However, without further context indicating it describes an emotional state, it is insufficient to conclude that it meets the criteria for the Feelings/Emotions code.
Step 2:"
444025:,C,Because no one can annoy me. ,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance indirectly meets the criteria for the Feelings/Emotions code. The phrase ""no one can annoy me"" implies a state of being unbothered or unaffected, which relates to emotions such as feeling calm, confident, or even a sense of pride. The emotional state is inferred rather than explicitly stated, but according to the code notes, emotions can be marked regardless of whether they are inferred or explicitly stated. The utterance conveys an emotional stance through the negation of the potential for annoyance, thus fitting within the broader interpretation of the code’s criteria. 
Step 2:"
33302:,T,"And what can you tell me about your bed that is that makes it, uh comfortable. ",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not contain any keywords or meet the code notes criteria for Feelings/Emotions. The focus is on obtaining descriptive information about a bed's comfort without expressing or naming any emotional or affective states directly or indirectly.  
Step 2:"
444001,C,They feel confused because they probably feel confused because confused because they they didn't understand why they like caught them and release them back.,1,"Step 1:#### The utterance explicitly uses the keyword ""confused"" to describe someone's emotional state, emphasizing confusion about a specific situation where individuals didn't understand the rationale behind an action. This usage fits within the coding manual's definition of capturing feelings/emotions, particularly under the specific emotion of confusion, which is listed as a keyword. Therefore, the utterance meets the criteria for the Feelings/Emotions code by describing an emotional state, using mental state language, and explicitly stating the emotion experienced in the situation described. 
Step 2:"
33301,T,It would probably feel happy and free.,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance explicitly mentions a feeling, ""happy,"" which directly corresponds with the keywords listed in the coding manual under feelings/emotions. This demonstrates that the utterance involves describing an emotional state, aligning with the directive to code for naming or describing emotional or affective states. Additionally, the use of the word ""feel"" fits within the parameters set by the coding manual for identifying instances of emotions or feelings being discussed.
Step 2:"
33308,T,"That's so sad, but that's a really good job that you're doing.",1,"Step 1:#### The utterance explicitly uses the word ""sad"" to describe an emotional state, which directly aligns with one of the specific keywords listed in the coding manual under the Feelings/Emotions code. Furthermore, the phrase ""that's a really good job"" implies a positive emotional state, corresponding to feelings such as pride or happiness, which are also covered by the coding manual. This statement names emotional states and hence meets the criteria for coding as Feelings/Emotions. 
Step 2:"
444001,C,"They will be surprised, happy even they might run off.",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance explicitly states emotions, namely ""surprised"" and ""happy,"" which directly aligns with the coding manual criteria for capturing feelings/emotions. Keywords ""surprised"" and ""happy"" are listed in the manual as examples of feelings/emotions that should be coded under this category. Furthermore, the description of potential actions based on these feelings (i.e., they might run off) supports the presence of emotional states, which the code notes mention as relevant for marking this code, regardless of whether the emotion is inferred or explicitly stated. Therefore, the utterance clearly meets the criteria for the Feelings/Emotions code.
Step 2:"
33304:,T,And why do you think you would feel happy?,1,"Step 1:#### The utterance directly asks for a description of an emotional state (happy), which matches the coding manual's emphasis on naming or describing emotional or affective states. The keyword ""feel happy"" is explicitly used, aligning with the criteria for the Feelings/Emotions code. This indicates the utterance is asking to understand or explain the cause of a positive emotional state, which captures the essence of the code's intent to identify discussions around feelings and emotions.
