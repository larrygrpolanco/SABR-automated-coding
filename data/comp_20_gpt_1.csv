Speaker,Teacher (T) or Child (C) Script (S),Utterance/Idea Units,Code,Compare_Contrast Explanation
33301,T,"Dani, what can you do to distinguish your bookbag from others that look just like it?",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance meets the criteria for the Compare/Contrast code as it directly prompts a comparison between the speaker's bookbag and others that are identical in appearance. It uses the keyword ""distinguish"" which implies identifying differences, therefore, it involves comparison at a literal level to make one's bookbag different from others. 
Step 2:"
33303,T,"Umm, ok, that’s an interesting way to carry a bookbag, but yea so that’s what distinguishes you as being different from others. ",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance includes the use of comparative keywords such as ""different"" and the context implies a comparison between how one individual carries a bookbag versus how others typically do. The statement explicitly marks a distinction (a form of comparison) between the subject and others, thus meeting the criteria for the Compare/Contrast code by identifying a difference in behavior that sets someone apart.
Step 2:"
33303,T,"Yea, yea, so, so I mean it’s a great thing but unique, umm possibly, so what about learning new things is unique that you do that other people don't do?",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance includes the word ""but"" as a conjunction to introduce a comparison between what is considered a ""great thing"" and the uniqueness of learning new things that the speaker does differently from others. The use of ""but"" in this context signifies an explicit comparison between the general appreciation of an activity and a specific manner of engaging with it that sets it apart from how others might. This falls within the criteria of identifying patterns or differences in behaviors or methods, as outlined in the code manual. 
Step 2:"
33308,T,What is one thing that makes you unique and special from everyone else?,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance prompts an explicit comparison between the individual being questioned and everyone else, focusing on identifying a unique or special quality that distinguishes the individual. By asking what makes the individual different from everyone else, it inherently requires a comparison, fitting the criteria for the Compare/Contrast code as it engages with identifying differences, which is a keyword aspect of this code. 
Step 2:"
33303,T,"So, can you tell me umm, what can you do to distinguish your bookbag from others that look like it?  ",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance meets the criteria for the Compare/Contrast code because it prompts for a response that identifies how one bookbag can be distinguished from others, implying a comparison between similar objects and suggesting a need to identify differences. The use of ""distinguish"" directly refers to identifying differences, which aligns with the coding manual's emphasis on references to similarities and differences as well as the explicit comparison or identification of patterns. Additionally, the context of distinguishing one's bookbag from others implicitly requires the identification of unique or contrasting features, hence engaging in a comparison.
Step 2:"
33306,T,Swamp is a region in the unit that can be found in the United States and what kinds of animals do you think we would find in swamps?,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not meet the criteria for the Compare/Contrast code. While it mentions a specific region (swamps) and asks about the types of animals found there, it does not make any explicit comparison or identification of patterns between entities, nor does it use any of the keywords associated with comparison or contrast as specified in the coding manual. The focus is on identifying what can be found in swamps without comparing or contrasting it to another entity or concept.
Step 2:"
33303,T,"Ok, so tell me how does that distinguishes you, how do other people carry their bookbags? ",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance explicitly encourages a comparison by asking how the subject's method of carrying bookbags differentiates from others. It uses the keyword ""how does that distinguishes you,"" which implies a comparison between the subject's method and others', focusing on differences in actions or characteristics regarding carrying bookbags. This aligns with the code's definition of identifying patterns or differences at any literal level and specifically asking for an explicit differentiation, which is a core aspect of the Compare/Contrast code. 
Step 2:"
33303:,T,"Yeah, umm, so it's a large piece of that different from other parts of land and like we don't live in desert, right, so it is the desert region, alright. ",1,"Step 1:#### The utterance seems to use comparative terms such as ""different"" and implicit comparison with the use of ""like we don't live in desert, right, so it is the desert region"", which compares the current region of discussion with a desert region. The speaker contrasts two types of land (the one being discussed and a desert), indicating an explicit reference to differences, which meets the criteria outlined in the code notes for comparing and contrasting different types or qualities of land. 
Step 2:"
444001,C,"You know, like the dodo birds.",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not explicitly engage in comparison or contrast as per the definition in the coding manual. The phrase ""like the dodo birds"" suggests a comparison may be inferred, but without additional context or explicit mention of similarities, differences, or any comparative keywords defined in the manual, it is challenging to conclude that it meets the criteria for Compare/Contrast code purely based on this information.    
Step 2:"
33301,T,Can you think of another type of region found in the United States?,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not contain any keywords related to comparing or contrasting nor does it imply a comparison through its phrasing. It simply asks for identification of another type of region, without engaging in comparison or contrast of regions. 
Step 2:"
33303:,T,"Umm, oh, yea, umm, and how does that, how does that contrast from other regions, so deserts, umm, what are they like? ",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance meets the criteria for the Compare/Contrast code as it explicitly asks for contrasting information between other regions and deserts, using the keyword ""contrast"" directly in the query. The speaker is seeking to identify differences between geographical regions, specifically focusing on deserts compared to other regions, which aligns with the code's emphasis on explicit references to comparison or identification of differences at any level.
Step 2:"
33301,T,"Umm do you think that you, the United States has a region with mountains or a region with glaciers?",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance involves an implicit comparison by asking to consider whether a particular area (the United States) contains two different geographic features: mountains or glaciers. The utterance encourages identifying the presence of distinct natural features in a specific region, thus comparing two types of physical geography within the United States. However, it does not use explicit comparative keywords listed in the coding manual, such as ""like,"" ""similar,"" or ""different."" Instead, it asks for identification, which might imply comparison based on the categorization of geographic features.
Step 2:"
33303,T,"So, what is one thing that makes you unique from everyone else?",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance prompts an explicit comparison between the individual and everyone else, focusing on the concept of uniqueness. The term ""unique"" inherently involves a comparison to identify differences, which aligns with the coding manual's definition that includes explicit references to comparison or identification of patterns at any level. Although it does not use the specific keywords listed in the manual, the essence of the question is to identify a difference, which falls under the category of comparing to highlight uniqueness (a difference).
Step 2:"
444015,C,"Uhm that it have like different, like different pockets.",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance meets the criteria for the Compare/Contrast code as it uses the word ""different"" explicitly, indicating a comparison between the pockets discussed in terms of their differences. The repetition of ""like different"" emphasizes a comparison, potentially of features or characteristics, fitting within the coding manual's definition and examples of identifying differences. 
Step 2:"
33306,T,"A shade. Like like an umbrella, right?",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance makes an explicit comparison using the keyword ""like"", comparing 'a shade' to 'an umbrella'. This indicates a reference to similarities based on the coding manual's definition for Compare/Contrast, which involves explicit references to comparison or identification of patterns at any literal or inferential levels, including use of comparative terms like ""like"".
Step 2:"
33303,T,One of them is going to be extinct but one of them is actually doing well.,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance meets the criteria for the Compare/Contrast code as it explicitly contrasts the states of two subjects by describing one as ""going to be extinct"" and the other as ""actually doing well."" This directly fits the definition of making a comparison or identifying a pattern at any literal level, using the contrast between their statuses.
Step 2:"
33306,T,"And so you being able to cook and cook unique things makes you unique compared to the people in your classroom, right?",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance explicitly compares the ability to cook unique things with other people in the classroom, highlighting how this skill differentiates someone, making them unique. The utterance uses comparative terms directly (""makes you unique compared to"") to discuss similarities and differences between individuals based on specific abilities. Thus, it aligns with the Compare/Contrast code definition, as it includes an explicit reference to comparison at an inferential level. 
Step 2:"
33301,T,Does she look like you?,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance meets the criteria for the Compare/Contrast code as it uses the keyword ""like"" to ask for a comparison of appearance between the speaker and another individual, thereby making an explicit reference to similarity, which aligns with the definition provided in the coding manual.
Step 2:"
33308,T,What is one thing that makes you unique and special from everyone else Dani?,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not contain any of the keywords related to the Compare/Contrast code such as like, similar, different, contrast, etc. While it does ask for a comparison on a personal level, it lacks an explicit reference to comparison or identification of patterns. The utterance is more focused on self-identification without directly comparing or contrasting to another entity using the specified comparative terms from the code notes.
Step 2:"
444001,C,"But sometimes and also they can be XXX, like the Peacock.",1,"Step 1:#### The utterance contains the keyword ""like,"" which indicates a comparison is being made, specifically comparing ""they"" to the ""Peacock."" This comparison suggests a similarity between two subjects, fitting the code definition's requirement for explicit references to comparison or identification of patterns at any level, including literal or inferential. 
Step 2:"
