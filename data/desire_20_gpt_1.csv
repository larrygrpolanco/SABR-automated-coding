33303,T,"So, now is there a problem in your community that you would like to help decrease? ",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not contain any keywords associated with desires/preferences such as ""like,"" ""want,"" ""prefer,"" ""wish,"" etc. It rather asks about a desire to address an issue in the community, indirectly implying a want or preference for change but not explicitly expressing a personal desire or preference according to the code manual's definition and examples. Therefore, it requires analysis beyond the mere presence of keywords, considering the intent and implication of reducing a community problem as a form of desire to improve or change a condition. 
Step 2:"
33301,T,"Um, what video games would you like to have in your large quantity?",1,"Step 1:#### The utterance explicitly asks for a person's preference regarding video games, which directly aligns with the 'Desires/Preferences' code definition involving expressing a greater liking for one alternative over another. The use of ""would you like to have"" directly solicits a preference, making it a clear expression of desiring or preferring certain video games over others. This aligns with the keywords and the requirement of inferring desires or preferences as per the code notes. 
Step 2:"
33301,T,You would rather have a larger amount of candy?,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance directly involves an inquiry about a preference, specifically whether the preference is for a larger amount of candy. The word ""rather"" clearly indicates a preference, aligning with the Desires/Preferences code's definition which includes expressing a greater liking for one alternative over another. The presence of this keyword and its usage within the context to inquire about a preference makes the utterance meet the criteria for the Desires/Preferences code. 
Step 2:"
33304:,T,"Ok, why do you like to settle down and relax at the couch?",1,"Step 1:#### The utterance queries about a personal preference regarding the activity of settling down and relaxing on the couch. It directly involves asking for an expression of a greater liking for one alternative (relaxing on the couch) over potentially other activities. This matches with the definition of Desires/Preferences which includes expressing a greater liking for one alternative over another. Although no direct keywords listed in the manual like 'prefer,' 'like,' or 'enjoy' are used by the questioner, the context of asking ""why do you like"" inherently implies a preference, aligning with the code's requirements to infer desires or preferences. 
Step 2:"
33301,T,"No, would you try it?",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not display any use of keywords related to desires/preferences, such as liking, wanting, or preferring something over another.

Step 2:"
33301,T,"So Dani, can you think of something that you would like to have large amounts of?",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance involves prompting someone to express a desire or preference regarding quantities, indicated by the phrasing ""would like to have large amounts of"". The use of the term ""would like"" directly aligns with the Desires/Preferences criteria as it expresses a wish or preference for something in particular. This prompts the respondent to reflect on their personal preferences or desires, thus meeting the code definition and keywords. 
Step 2:"
444011,C,"Um, I mostly like, um, snakes.",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance meets the criteria for the Desires/Preferences code as it explicitly expresses a preference for snakes over possibly other animals or things. The keyword ""like"" is used here to indicate a greater liking for one alternative over another, which aligns with the definition of expressing a greater liking for one alternative over another. The ums in the utterance do not detract from the expression of preference, as the core statement ""I mostly like, um, snakes"" maintains the expression of preference clearly.
Step 2:"
33303:,C,"So, can you think of something that you would like to have in large amounts and can you tell me about it?",1,"Step 1:#### The utterance prompts for a desire or preference by asking what the individual would like to have in large amounts. This directly involves wishing or wanting something, fitting the criteria for the Desires/Preferences code. The use of ""like"" implies a preference, meeting the coding manual's guidance on inferring desires and preferences. 
Step 2:"
33304:,T,"So, I wouldn't wanna live on this.",1,"Step 1:#### The utterance contains the phrase ""wouldn't wanna live on this,"" explicitly expressing a desire or preference about not wanting to live in a certain place. The use of ""wouldn't wanna"" directly aligns with the given coding criteria for Desires/Preferences, which includes wishing or wanting something, or expressing a greater liking for one alternative over another. The statement suggests a clear preference against living in the specified context, which meets the criteria outlined in the coding manual.
Step 2:"
33301,T,You like alligators?,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not explicitly meet the criteria for Desires/Preferences as it poses a question about another's preference but does not express a desire, preference, or greater liking for one alternative over another directly. The use of ""like"" here does not communicate the speaker's preference but rather inquires about someone else's, without inferring or stating a desire. 
Step 2:"
33308,T,Is there anything else you like?,1,"Step 1:#### The utterance uses the keyword ""like"" in a context that indicates a query about preferences, thus aligning with the Desires/Preferences code. The utterance is inquiring about additional things the individual prefers or is fond of, which directly involves expressing a liking for alternatives or identifying personal or others' preferences. 
Step 2:"
33304:,T,Why do you wanna have a large amount of prime?,1,"Step 1:#### The utterance involves expressing a want, indicated by the use of ""wanna"" (a contraction of ""want to""), which falls under the category of expressing a desire. This aligns with the definition of the Desires/Preferences code, which includes wishing or wanting something. The keyword ""want"" directly matches one of the listed keywords for this code, making it a clear indicator that the utterance expresses a desire or preference. There is no explicit preference over alternatives mentioned, but the desire to have something in a large amount is clearly stated, fulfilling the criteria of expressing a desire or preference.
Step 2:"
33306,T,Do you like to compete in any sports?,1,"Step 1:#### The utterance includes the keyword ""like"" in a context that is explicitly asking about a preference for competing in sports. This matches the code's criteria for identifying desires or preferences. The question is directed towards understanding if the individual has a greater liking for competing in sports, which is directly aligned with expressing a preference. 
Step 2:"
33304:,T,But do you like going there?,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance meets the criteria for the Desires/Preferences code because it explicitly uses the word ""like"" in a context that implies asking about someone's preference regarding going to a specific place. The use of ""like"" here is directly related to expressing a preference, which aligns with the definition of the code as involving a greater liking for one alternative over another. 
Step 2:"
444001,C,And I like to see.,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance contains the keyword ""like"" which indicates a preference. However, without additional context indicating a preference for one alternative over another, or a wish/want, it is difficult to determine if this statement is expressing a preference in the sense defined by the coding manual. The utterance simply states a general liking (""like to see"") without specifying an object or subject of comparison, intention, or desire as outlined in the code notes.
Step 2:"
33304,T,"So Dani, is there a problem in your Community that you would like to help to decrease?",X,"Step 1:#### The utterance inquires about a desire or wish to engage in problem-solving within a community context, which is related to expressing an intention to make a positive change rather than a personal preference, love, dislike, or keen interest in something. Although it evokes a consideration of what the speaker ""would like"" in terms of action or involvement, it does not directly express a preference for one alternative over another in the context of personal desires or likes. The coding manual emphasizes expressions of preference, liking, or wanting in particular alternatives, and this inquiry is more about identifying an intention or a problem-solving desire rather than a personal preference or liking. 
Step 2:"
33304:,T,"So, you like it?",1,"Step 1:#### The utterance contains the keyword ""like,"" which in this context is used to inquire about a preference, indicating that it meets the criteria for the Desires/Preferences code. The sentence explicitly asks about someone's liking (preference) for something, fitting within the definition of expressing a greater liking for one alternative over another. Therefore, the criteria for coding as Desires/Preferences is met based on the use of a keyword indicating preference.  
Step 2:"
33301,T,"Dani, name something that you think, name something that you would like to have in large quantities.",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance includes an explicit request for the listener (Dani) to express a personal desire or preference regarding something they would like to have in large quantities. The phrase ""would like to have"" directly aligns with the expressing of a greater liking for one alternative over another, and fits perfectly within the definition of the Desires/Preferences code. No specific keywords from the manual are explicitly used in this utterance, but the overall context of ""would like to have"" sufficiently conveys a desire or preference, making it adhere to the criteria for coding as Desires/Preferences. 
Step 2:"
444011,C,"Their name is the other the boys and they do like a lot of hunting, traveling and yeah.",1,"Step 1:#### The utterance suggests that someone enjoys certain activities, specifically hunting and traveling. The presence of ""do like"" aligns with expressing a greater liking for one alternative over another, which meets the criteria outlined for the Desires/Preferences code. Although the phrase ""do like"" is not explicitly listed as a keyword, it conveys a meaning of preference, which is in line with the code's definition of involving wishing or wanting something, or expressing a greater liking for one alternative over another. 
Step 2:"
444001,C,"My favorite animal is a cat, and dogs and manatees.",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance explicitly states a preference, indicating the speaker's favorite animal as a cat, and also mentions dogs and manatees, which implies a preference or fondness for them as well.
