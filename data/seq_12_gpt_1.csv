33308,T,Can you think of a time where you were blamed for something that you did not do?,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance includes a reference to ""time"" which is a keyword identified in the coding manual under the Sequence/Temporal code. The question asks the respondent to recall a specific instance (""a time"") where a particular event occurred, thereby aligning with the code's criteria regarding references to time. This demonstrates the use of time to organize thoughts or recall specific events, which falls within the scope of temporal language as outlined in the code notes. However, it does not explicitly reference a sequence or order of events, nor does it provide a detailed temporal ordering but merely invokes a recall of a time-based event. The focus on a singular time point does align with general orientations in time, fulfilling a part of the code's definition.
Step 2:"
33304:,T,"Dani, can you think of a time when you were blamed for something you did not do? ",X,"Step 1:#### The utterance prompts an individual to think of a specific instance in time, seeking a narrative or explanation that involves temporality. It explicitly asks for a ""time"" which is a keyword under the Sequence/Temporal code, indicating a reference to a moment or period. The utterance, however, focuses on personal experience rather than explicitly discussing the sequence of events or the timing/duration of an event in a more general or abstract sense.
Step 2:"
33306,T,They no longer exist.,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not contain any keywords related to sequence/temporal aspects as outlined in the coding manual. It lacks reference to time or the ordering of events. It merely states a fact without providing details on timing or sequence.
Step 2:"
33306,T,"They died a long, long time ago.",1,"Step 1:#### The utterance explicitly references a time duration (""a long, long time ago""), which fits within the guidelines of referencing time and temporal ordering as outlined in the code notes. It conveys a when an event (in this case, 'they died') occurred, indicating a placement in time which is abstract and relevant to sequence/temporal coding criteria. It does not mention specific temporal keywords, but the phrase ""a long, long time ago"" clearly indicates a general orientation in time, which meets the definition of referring to the timing or duration of events.
Step 2:"
33306,T,How do we know that they once were in existence?,X,"Step 1:#### The utterance does not contain any keywords related to sequence/temporal aspects nor does it discuss when events occurred in a sequence or references to time. It questions the existence of something in the past but without explicit reference to a timeframe or sequence of events. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for the Sequence/Temporal code based on the coding manual's definition and notes.
Step 2:"
444007,C,Because they just die one day?,X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not explicitly discuss when events occurred in a sequence or reference to time based on the keywords or surrounding context provided in the coding manual. The question does mention a time-related concept (""one day"") but lacks a clear reference to sequence/temporal ordering of events, specific times, or duration that the coding manual stipulates.
Step 2:"
33301,T,"Right, they maybe just died one day.",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance implies an event occurring at a specific point in time with the use of ""one day,"" which is relevant to the Sequence/Temporal code's definition and keywords. The phrase ""one day"" refers to a particular time when the events took place, aligning with the coding manual's emphasis on explicit discussions of when events occur or references to time.
Step 2:"
444001,C,XXX two days she was missing.,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance meets the criteria for the Sequence/Temporal code as it includes a reference to time (""two days"") in the context of discussing an event's duration (someone was missing for a specific period). This aligns with the code notes that state references to the timing or duration of events are included, as well as references to more general orientations in time.
Step 2:"
444001,C,"No, but my other my other dog came back yesterday.",1,"Step 1:#### This utterance contains the keyword ""yesterday,"" which indicates a reference to time. According to the coding manual, references to specific days qualify under the Sequence/Temporal code as they relate to the timing or duration of events and provide an orientation in time. Thus, the mention of ""yesterday"" directly aligns with the criteria for this code. 
Step 2:"
444001,C,"XXX these plant eaters or hard time finding food in the died of hunger and they didn't they couldn't find water, but really mermaids,it is the same thing that happened with the dinosaurs.",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not directly involve discussions of when events occurred in a sequence or references to time based on the provided keywords or definitions. It mentions events related to plant eaters and dinosaurs dying due to lack of food and water, but does not specifically address time or sequence/temporal ordering. There are no explicit mentions of keywords related to sequence (e.g., first, next, last) or time (e.g., yesterday, today, minute). Therefore, according to the coding manual, it does not meet the criteria. 
Step 2:"
444026,C,This is because they lived for a very long time and then died because they were old.,1,"Step 1:#### This utterance references a sequence of events involving duration (""lived for a very long time"") and concludes with an outcome (""then died because they were old""), which implies a temporal sequence of life to death. The mention of a very long time indicates a duration aspect, aligning with the code regarding the timing or duration of events. 
Step 2:"
33303,T,"Yeah, yeah, they are all dead now, XXX, so they are no longer part of this world, really, really good example, I love megalodons.",X,"Step 1:#### This utterance does not include any specific references to sequence or time as defined by the coding manual. It does not use keywords related to sequential order or time (e.g., ""first"", ""next"", ""yesterday"", ""today"", ""minute"", etc.), nor does it reference a temporal ordering of events, the timing or duration of events, or general orientations in time. The conversation seems to be about megalodons and their current status of existence, without discussing when events occurred or mentioning any time-related aspects.
