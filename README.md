# SABR-automated-coding

This tool is designed to streamline the process of coding educational research data, specifically focusing on the analysis of language used in classroom settings or research studies. It uses advanced language models to automatically assign specific linguistic or thematic codes to snippets of text, which can be incredibly valuable in language learning and teaching research.

How it Works:

* Upload Your Data: You start by uploading a transcript or any textual data in an Excel format. This could be dialogue from classroom interactions, student responses, or any relevant text data.

* Automatic Coding: Select from various predefined linguistic and thematic codes such as "Sequence/Temporal," "Compare/Contrast," or "Feelings/Emotions." The tool then processes each utterance in your data, automatically applying these codes based on the content.

* Detailed Insights: For each coded piece, the tool can provide explanations, showing you why an utterance was assigned a particular code. This feature helps in understanding the coding decisions and can be used for training or validation purposes.

* Efficient and Time-Saving: The entire coding process is quick and automated, allowing you to focus more on analyzing the results and less on the manual work of coding data.

Benefits for Teachers and Researchers:

Auto-SABR-coding is ideal for those involved in educational research or teachers looking to analyze classroom language. It offers a fast, reliable way to examine how language is used in educational contexts, helping to enhance teaching strategies and better understand student interactions.
