# SABR-automated-coding

SABR (Systematic Assessment of Book Reading) is a prototype tool that revolutionizes the process of coding educational research data. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), it transforms what traditionally takes researchers hours or days into a task that can be completed in minutes.

## What It Does

This tool streamlines the analysis of language used in classroom settings or research studies by automatically assigning specific linguistic or thematic codes to text snippets. It ingeniously employs LLMs to recognize patterns in natural language that correspond to research-relevant categories.

## How It Works

* **Upload Your Data:** Start by uploading a transcript or textual data in CSV format. This could be dialogue from classroom interactions, student responses, or any text-based research data.

* **Automatic Coding:** Select from various predefined linguistic and thematic codes such as "Sequence/Temporal," "Compare/Contrast," or "Feelings/Emotions." The tool processes each utterance, automatically applying appropriate codes.

* **Detailed Insights:** For each coded piece, the tool provides explanations for why a particular code was assigned, helping researchers understand the coding decisions.

## Validation and Testing

This prototype has been rigorously tested against human coders. Agreement data has been collected comparing machine coding against expert human coding, with promising results that suggest the potential for LLMs to assist in qualitative research tasks.

## Current Status

SABR is currently a proof of concept and has not yet been used in published studies. With continued development, it could be substantially improved to include:

* More sophisticated linguistic analysis
* Additional coding schemes
* Enhanced explanation capabilities
* Integration with other research tools

This project demonstrates the potential for AI to augment qualitative research methods, potentially making sophisticated coding techniques more accessible to researchers with limited resources.
